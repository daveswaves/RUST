In addition to the Debug trait,
Rust has provided a number of traits for us to use
With the derive attribute that can add useful behavior to our custom types.
Those traits and their behaviors are listed in Appendix C.
We’ll cover how to implement these traits with custom behavior as well as how to create your own traits in Chapter 10.
There are also many attributes other than derive; for more information, see the “Attributes” section of the Rust Reference.
